# If you are reading me that you are going learning the design patterns.
Can I help you? No, of course!

Please, read The BOOK "Head First Design Patterns"

By Eric Freeman & Elisabeth Robson

with Kathy Sierra & Bert Bates. 

* Note: There are some examples here from The BOOK and few thoughts that seem me important. *

**Please, excuse me for my unnative and sintetic english))**

### Pattern 1 STRATEGY
This pattern helps me to understand "Polimorph type".
It was like a thunderbolt) A super type is cool! 

**All the varies must be exluded - “encapsulated”.**

### Pattern 2 OBSERVER
If you need to update some objects (OBSERVERS) after when the SUBJECT has updated, **use the Observer Pattern.**
Is it clearly? Not, ok! See Chapter 2 The book. 

The v0.2.0b1 The Observer is got updated parameters.
The v0.2.1 The Observer get updated parameters itself.
